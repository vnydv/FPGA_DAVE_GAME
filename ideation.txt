50 MHz clock - 4 clk cycles / isa -> 50/4 = 12.5 MHz CPU
25 MHz VGA - get hpos / vpos - 60 fps

ckt to calc. SpriteIndex

----
lda NAME_TABLE_ADR      - 2 clk
add A SPRITE_OFFSET     - 

--- CPU controls movements
--- Make a PPU no code
--- direct sprite rendering from nametable

ppu gets hpos vpos - it has it's own sprite ROM
calculate SpriteAddress and DisplayAddress automatically

-- use a loading screen - (just 1 location in memory)
-- and a boot module to show booting sequence - nothing else
-- PU_RAM only has to store NAME_TABLE right from start
-- gen a signal that it's ready
-- default initalisation

-- name table is in PU RAM (Dual port)
-- now cpu can work --

cpu doesn't have to sync with PPU
